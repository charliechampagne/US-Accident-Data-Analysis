🚗 New Project Completed: US Accident Data Analysis Using Python 🚗

I’m excited to share my latest project where I analyzed a comprehensive dataset on car accidents in the United States. The goal was to identify factors that influence the length of road affected by these accidents and to derive valuable insights that can help improve road safety measures.

🔍 Key Highlights:

1. Data Processing & Cleaning: Worked with a dataset containing over 246,000 records. Managed missing values, removed duplicates, and transformed data types to ensure data quality.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and trends:
   - Top Cities for Accidents: Los Angeles and Miami lead the list, contributing to approximately 4.5% of the total accidents.
   - Least Affected Areas: Rhode Island reported the least number of accidents, indicating its relatively safer roads.
   - Accidents by Severity: Most severe accidents were concentrated in the eastern part of the US.

3. Spatial & Temporal Analysis: Utilized interactive maps and time-based analysis to visualize accident hotspots and peak accident hours, which usually occur during morning and evening rush hours.

4. Machine Learning Model Development: Built a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the length of road affected by accidents. Key features affecting road length were:
   - Air Pressure and Visibility
   - Temperature at Location
   - Weather Conditions like Snow

5. Results: The model achieved an RMSE of 1.91, providing reliable predictions that can help stakeholders focus on critical factors contributing to road accidents.

📈 Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

🌟 Outcome: The project provides actionable insights that could help policy makers and city planners make data-driven decisions to enhance road safety.

I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to work on this impactful project and leverage data science to contribute to public safety! 🚀
